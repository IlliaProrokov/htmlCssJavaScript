        <p> Hello! I'm glad you're here. This is the home page of my first multi-page website project. I am currently learning web development, focusing on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS to build solid, accessible structures.</p>
        
        <p>I believe that good planning is key to successful coding. My interests include [Music] and [Cars], which you can read more about on my About page.</p>
