        <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
        
        <p> Hello! I am [Your Name], and I am currently working on building my first multi-page website using HTML. I enjoy [Your Hobby] and am passionate about learning new technologies.</p>
        
        <p>The goal of this exercise is to master basic HTML structure and navigation. I believe that a strong foundation in markup languages is key to becoming a successful developer.</p>

        <p>If you'd like to read more about my background and interests, please visit the <a href="about.html">About page</a>.</p>

        <p>I often get great tips from this resource: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs (External Link)</a></p>
